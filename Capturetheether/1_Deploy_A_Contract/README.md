# Deploy a contract (Warmup)

## CATEGORY

Smart Contracts

## Challenge

To complete this challenge, you need to:

1. Install MetaMask.
2. Switch to the Ropsten test network.
3. Get some Ropsten ether. Clicking the “buy” button in MetaMask will take you to a faucet that gives out free test ether.

After you’ve done that, press the red button on the left to deploy the challenge contract.

You don’t need to do anything with the contract once it’s deployed. Just click the “Check Solution” button to verify that you deployed successfully.

## Solution
